## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AI_Powered_Code_Review_Bot.git
cd AI_Powered_Code_Review_Bot

### 2. Create a virtual environment

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

### 3. Install Dependencies


pip install -r requirements.txt

### 4. Create .env file
Create a .env file in the root directory with the following content:

GITHUB_API_KEY=your_github_personal_access_token
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```
Your GitHub token must have **repo** and **workflow** scopes.

## 🔗 Github Webhook Setup

1. Go to your GitHub repository → **Settings** → **Webhooks** → **Add webhook**

2. Set the following:

* **Payload URL**: http://your-domain.com/webhook or http://localhost:5000/webhook

* **Content type**: application/json

* **Events to trigger**:

    * ✅ Pull requests

    * ✅ Push

    * ✅ Issue comments

3. Save the webhook.

## 🌐 Endpoints

| Route  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| /webhook  | Receives GitHub webhook events  |
| /dashboard  | Displays all past code reviews  |

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. GitHub triggers a webhook on PR open/sync/reopen.
2. The bot:
    * Fetches modified .py files
    * Sends the code to OpenAI for review
    * Posts review comments to the PR
    * Adds an approval or improvement label
    * Merges the PR if approved
3. Reviews are logged in-memory and visible via /dashboard.

---

## 💡 Example Workflow

* Developer opens a PR.
* Bot gets triggered via webhook.
* AI analyzes the Python files and posts detailed feedback.
* PR is labeled and potentially auto-merged.
* Review logs are stored and shown on the dashboard.
